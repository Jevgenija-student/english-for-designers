### Drop Cap / Letter Design
**Chosen letter:** A

**Why I chose this letter:**  
I chose the letter A because it is simple and strong, but now I wanted to give it a playful twist. Turning it into a 3D purple balloon adds volume, fun, and a unique character while keeping it recognizable.

**Process:**  
I started by sketching the letter A in a standard font. Then, I added rounded, inflated edges to make it look like a balloon. I used gradients of purple to create a 3D effect, with highlights and soft shadows to simulate light reflecting off the surface. Finally, I refined the contours to keep the shape clean and readable, even with the playful, bouncy style.

### Type Specimen

**Original text:**  
Typography plays an important role in visual communication. It helps guide the reader, creates hierarchy, and influences how content is perceived. In this design, the letter A is presented as a playful 3D purple balloon, adding a fun and eye-catching element while remaining readable. Good typography is not only decorative but also functional and accessible.

**Design notes:**  
I focused on readability, spacing, and hierarchy, while giving the initial letter a playful twist. The 3D purple balloon A adds volume, highlights, and a tactile feel, creating a visual focal point without sacrificing clarity. I maintained contrast between headings and body text and avoided unnecessary decoration.

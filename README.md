## Content First

### Drop Cap / Letter Design
**Chosen letter:** A

**Why I chose this letter:**  
I chose the letter A because it is simple, strong, and visually balanced. It allowed me to focus on shape, contrast, and proportion rather than decoration.

**Process:**  
I created several sketches and digital versions. Some versions were too decorative and difficult to read. I decided to keep the final design clean and legible.

### Alt Text Writing

**Alt text version 1:**  
A decorative letter A designed as a drop cap with thick strokes and sharp edges.

**Alt text version 2:**  
A black drop cap letter A with strong contrast and a geometric shape.

**Alt text version 3 (AI-assisted, edited):**  
A stylized drop cap letter A with bold lines and a minimal decorative structure.

**Final alt text:**  
A bold drop cap letter A with clean geometric lines designed for clear readability.

### Type Specimen

**Original text:**  
Typography plays an important role in visual communication. It helps guide the reader, creates hierarchy, and influences how content is perceived. Good typography is not only decorative but also functional and accessible.

**Design notes:**  
I focused on readability, spacing, and hierarchy. I used contrast between headings and body text and avoided unnecessary decoration.
